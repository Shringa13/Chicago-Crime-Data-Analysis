The Chicago Crime Data analysis reflects the crime incidents that occured in the city of Chicago from 2008-2018. The objective of the project is to identify the crime types and which type have the highest rate.There are total 615625 rows and 25 features of data.
This project is dedicated to doing some cool data analysis and visualization on this already curated dataset.

I have also visualize the rate of crime by hour i.e. which type of crime has high rate at what hour of the day.

By the end of the analysis I have comapred crime rates with the weather and during which month of the year crime rate is high. As we can see from the below image that crimes rates are very high between May - September i.e. during the FALL time.
